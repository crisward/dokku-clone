A dokku plugin which allows you to create an app from a git url


## Requirements

* dokku 0.4.0+

## Installation

```bash
# on 0.4.x
dokku plugin:install https://github.com/crisward/dokku-clone.git clone
```

## Usage

```bash
# create or update and app from eg github
dokku@dokku.me clone yourapp https://github.com/you/yourproject.git

#eg 
ssh dokku@dokku.me clone nodetest https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started.git

# you'll then have the heroku sample app on nodetest.dokku.me (you may have to update your hosts file)
```

### Private Repos / git urls

If you need to clone private repos, or just want to use git@ urls you'll need to add a deploy key to your git provider (ie github).
If you want to be able to pull any repo from github, you'll have to add the key [here](https://github.com/settings/ssh)
Clone creates a fresh keypair when the plugin is first installed. The public part of the key can be accessed with.

```bash
# output with
ssh dokku@dokku.me clone:key

# save to clipboard with (mac only)
ssh dokku@dokku.me clone:key | pbcopy

# before cloning the repo, you'll need to add the remote to known hosts with
ssh dokku@dokku.me clone:allow github.com
```

### Cloning Branches and Tags

If you would like to build your app from another branch or tag your can pass that is a a third parameter
ie.

```bash
ssh dokku@dokku.me clone nodetest https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started.git 2016
```
